*\*Greetings in Vietnamese*

I'm Vu, a PhD student ðŸŽ“ at [CMU Musculoskeletal Biomechanics Lab](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/faculty/halilaj-musculoskeletal-biomechanics-lab.html). My current research focuses on developing tools to enable/improve inertial motion tracking in natural environments.  

I have actively attended anual meetings of the [American Society of Biomechanics (ASB)](https://asbweb.org/) to present my up-to-date projects. Some outcomes of my previous studies were published in well-known journals ðŸ“° to the biomechanics community such as *Journal of Biomechanics* or *IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering (IEEE TBME)*. Please visit [my personal website](https://vuu-phan.github.io/) for further information.
